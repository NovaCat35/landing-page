# Landing-Page

What a journey this has been! This landing project is a place for me to explore my own understanding of the craft and my ability in the fundamentals of web development. I added to this project throughout many months(and breaks) as I learned new things along the way. Many thanks to the Odin Project for providing the tools I need to tackle this path and others in the future.
